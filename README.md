# 2. Dataset preparation
The testing datasets are avalible in:[SatSOT](http://www.csu.cas.cn/gb/kybm/sjlyzx/gcxx_sjj/sjj_wxxl/202106/t20210607_6080256.html)，[SV248S](https://github.com/xdai-dlgvv/SV248S)，[OOTB](https://github.com/YZCU/OOTB) and [VISO](https://github.com/QingyongHu/VISO), which are all large public real satellite video datasets. <bar>
The training dataset contains four commonly used datasets for general video object tracking in the field of computer vision, which can be easily obtained from the official websites of their respective datasets.
